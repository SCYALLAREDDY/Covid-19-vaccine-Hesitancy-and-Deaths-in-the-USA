## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 mortality data to explore the influence of age on susceptibility to death. Through the utilization of visualizations, we aim to depict mortality rates within distinct age groups and compare mortality patterns between males and females across various age brackets. Additionally, we will examine the total deaths attributed to COVID-19 during different phases of the pandemic, focusing on the initial and final weeks.

Beyond age-related analyses, the project delves into the correlation between county population size and COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population, as well as the relationship between county population size and the rate of COVID-19 hospital admissions per 100,000 population. The goal is to provide insights into the nuanced dynamics of COVID-19 mortality across demographic and temporal dimensions.

## Objectives
Identify healthcare facilities and COVID-19 death rates in Bronx County according to verified cases and age.
Analyze data trends, patterns, and discrepancies to educate the public and healthcare providers, supporting informed decision-making.
Utilize Excel for data cleansing and Tableau for visualization.
## Data Sources
The following datasets are used in this analysis:

Bronx County COVID-19 death, hospitalization, and bed datasets
USA Facts COVID-19 spread map
In total, 126,524 records will be analyzed as part of this study.

## Hypotheses
Age Impact: The age group 75 to 84 years has a higher proportion of patients experiencing severe outcomes (ICU admission, intubation, and fatalities) compared to the age group 20 to 44 years in Bronx County.
Healthcare Capacity: The availability of staffed beds in Bronx County significantly affects the number of patients currently hospitalized and the ICU utilization rate.
Trends Over Time: The cumulative COVID-19 discharges and fatalities in Bronx County exhibit distinct trends over time.
Comparison with NYC: Bronx County's COVID-19 hospitalization rates and outcomes differ significantly from other counties within New York City.
